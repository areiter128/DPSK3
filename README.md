# MPLAB Digital Power Starter Kit v3 (DPSK3)

Out-Of-The-Box firmware for Microchip Technology's MPLAB Digital Power Starter Kit v3 featuring dsPIC33CK Switched-Mode Power Supply Digital Signal Controller.

This repository holds two very different firmware versions:

## 1) Original Firmware (branches original_master, orignal_develop, original_hotfix, etc.)  
This original firmware verson is suffering from a number of startup and runtime issues which need to be resolved before product release. 
The initial version was tag-ed with v0.9.0.
All existing issues have been added as **Issues** to this repository and a **Project** has been added to organize the hotfix workflow.

The branching model for the hotfixes still foolows the usual scheme:

* Branch orinial_master  
    this is the branch holding the releases. **Do not commit changes to this branch.**

* Branch orinial_develop  
    this is the test branch where hotfixes are merged into and tested before being merged into __original_master__. 

* Branch orinial_develop  
    each HOTFIX is seperated in its own branch, starting with **orinial_hotfix_ [_issue title_]**  
	
### Please look up work items in **Project DPSK3-Initial Firmware Bugfixes** for details  
* Create/Review Tickets: https://github.com/areiter128/DPSK3/issues
* Project Overview: https://github.com/areiter128/DPSK3/projects/1
* Latest Releases:  https://github.com/areiter128/DPSK3/releases/latest

**PLEASE NOTE:**  
Please consider this project as **Prototype Firmware** only. Once all Hotfixes have been integrated, we will pull the plug on this project and move all project files back to SVN. All future firmware versions will be build on the **_New Firmware Version_**.


## 2) New Firmware Version (branches master, develop, feature, etc.)  
As the original firmware has been hot-needled, a more consistent, easier to read and understand firmware version is desired.
The preferred version is to have very basic, well commented single-bit configurations for every peripheral isolated in separated files for each peripheral block.
The state machine should be driven from the main()-loop. 
For simplicity it is desired **not** having any hidden libraries included and **not** using code generation tools like MCC at this point. 
All tools used (e.g. to derive parameters) have to be officially released or at least be publicly available to end-users.
